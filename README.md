# Software Security Project  

This project focuses on analyzing a publicly available source code repository to identify vulnerabilities and propose effective mitigations.  

## Overview  
The source code repository selected for this project is **Monero**, a widely known open-source project. The analysis was conducted using **SonarQube**, a leading tool for code quality and vulnerability detection.  

## Project Steps  
1. **Source Code Analysis**:  
   - The Monero repository was analyzed using SonarQube to identify vulnerabilities.  
   - The analysis results were documented, focusing on vulnerabilities with high severity levels.  

2. **Mitigation Plan**:  
   - Mitigation strategies were devised based on recommendations from **CWE guidelines**.  
   - These include fixes to the code, applying secure design principles, and referencing OWASP cheat sheets.  

3. **Attack Scenarios**:  
   - Realistic attack scenarios were created to demonstrate potential exploitation of identified vulnerabilities.  
   - Each scenario includes a detailed mitigation plan.  

4. **Threat Modeling**:  
   - A **threat modeling tool** was used to further investigate potential vulnerabilities and threats within the system.  
   - This analysis helped identify and address additional risks beyond the detected vulnerabilities.
